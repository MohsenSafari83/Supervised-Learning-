# 🐍 Python Cheat Sheet

This folder contains a **cheat sheet** for some of the most important Python libraries used in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.  
The goal is to provide a **quick reference** to commonly used commands and workflows.

---

## What’s Inside?
The cheat sheet covers three major Python libraries:

### 🔹 NumPy
- Working with arrays and matrices  
- Array creation (`zeros`, `ones`, `arange`, `random`)  
- Array operations (mean, median, std, sum, min, max)  
- Indexing and slicing  

### 🔹 Matplotlib
- Basic plotting (line, scatter, bar, histogram)  
- Customization (titles, labels, legends, grids)  
- Visualizing numerical data  

### 🔹 Seaborn
- High-level statistical plots (scatterplot, lineplot, histplot, boxplot, violinplot)  
- Heatmaps for correlation matrices  
- Styling and color palettes

## Purpose
- Provide a **handy guide** for students, analysts, and ML practitioners  
- Help recall the most commonly used commands quickly  
- Serve as a **starting point** for exploring each library
