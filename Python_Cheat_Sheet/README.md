# 🐍 Python Cheat Sheet

This folder contains a **cheat sheet** for some of the most important Python libraries used in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.  
The goal is to provide a **quick reference** to commonly used commands and workflows.

---

## What’s Inside?
The cheat sheet covers three major Python libraries:
### 🔹 NumPy – Data Management
- Covers the most important and commonly used methods for array manipulation and data preparation

### 🔹 Matplotlib – Data Visualization
- Line plots for trends and sequences  
- Scatter plots for relationships between variables  
- Histograms to check distributions  
- Bar charts for category comparisons  
- Boxplots to visualize spread and detect outliers  
- Subplots to compare multiple plots side by side
  

### 🔹 Seaborn – Data Visualization
- Distribution plots (histograms, KDE, ECDF)  
- Scatterplots with categories and sizes  
- Boxplots for outliers and data spread  
- Violinplots and pairwise plots for feature relationships

## Purpose
- Provide a **handy guide** for students, analysts, and ML practitioners  
- Help recall the most commonly used commands quickly  
- Serve as a **starting point** for exploring each library
