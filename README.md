# 🌐 Supervised Learning

Welcome to this repository!  
Here we aim to **document the theory of classification algorithms** in machine learning with a focus on **clarity, examples, and visuals**.  
The idea is to make learning **both theoretical and practical**, so you can connect formulas to real-world applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✏️ Explain the theory of key classification algorithms in **plain, simple language**  
- 📊 Provide hands-on examples with **charts and visualizations**  
- ⚖️ Compare algorithms in terms of **performance and use cases**  
- 📈 Explore tools for evaluating **accuracy** and **effectiveness**  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 📝 Introduction to supervised learning  
- 🔹 Perceptron and simple linear classifiers  
- 🔹 Logistic Regression  
- 🔹 Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- 🌳 Decision Trees and Random Forests  
- 🧠 Simple Neural Networks for classification  
- 📏 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC, AUC  

---

## 💡 Examples
Each algorithm will be explained with:
- A **simple example** using small synthetic or real datasets  
- **Step-by-step explanations**  
- **Visuals and charts** for better intuition
