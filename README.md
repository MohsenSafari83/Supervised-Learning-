# 🌐 Supervised Learning

Welcome to this repository!  
Here we aim to **document the theory of classification and Linear Regression algorithms** in machine learning with a focus on **clarity, examples, and visuals**.  
The idea is to make learning **both theoretical and practical**, so you can connect formulas to real-world applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✏️ Explain the theory of key classification and Linear Regression algorithms in 
- 📊 Provide hands-on examples with **charts and visualizations**  
- ⚖️ Compare algorithms in terms of **performance and use cases**  
- 📈 Explore tools for evaluating **accuracy** and **effectiveness**  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 📝 Introduction to supervised learning
- 🔹 Linear Regression
- 🔹 Logistic Regression  
- 🔹 Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- 🌳 Decision Trees and Random Forests  
- 📏 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC, AUC  

---

## 💡 Examples
Each algorithm will be explained with:
- A **simple example** using small synthetic or real datasets  
- **Step-by-step explanations**  
- **Visuals and charts** for better intuition  

---
## 📖 Documentation

Theoretical notes and examples are organized in separate files for each algorithm:

- [Linear Regression](./Linear%20Regression) – Introduction, theory, examples, and visualizations.

✨ The goal is to make theory **easy to understand** and connect it directly to **practice**.
