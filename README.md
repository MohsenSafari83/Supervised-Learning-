# 🌐 Supervised Learning

Welcome to this repository!  
Here we aim to **document the theory of classification and Linear Regression algorithms** in machine learning with a focus on **clarity, examples, and visuals**.  
The idea is to make learning **both theoretical and practical**, so you can connect formulas to real-world applications.

---

## Objectives
-  Explain the theory of key classification and Linear Regression algorithms in 
-  Provide hands-on examples with **charts and visualizations**  
-  Compare algorithms in terms of **performance and use cases**  
-  Explore tools for evaluating **accuracy** and **effectiveness**  

---

##  Topics Covered
- 🔹 Introduction to supervised learning
- 🔹 Linear Regression
- 🔹 Logistic Regression  
- 🔹 Support Vector Machines 9(SVM)
- 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- 🔹 Ensemble Learning
- 🔹 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC, AUC  

---

##  Examples
Each algorithm will be explained with:
- A **simple example** using small synthetic or real datasets  
- **Step-by-step explanations**  
- **Visuals and charts** for better intuition  

---
## 📖 Documentation

Theoretical notes and examples are organized in separate files for each algorithm:

- 🔹[Linear Regression](./Linear%20Regression)  
- 🔹[Logistic Regression](./Logistic%20Regression)
- 🔹[K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](./KNN)   
- 🔹[Support Vector Machines (SVM)](./SVM)  
- 🔹[Ensemble Learning](./Ensemble%20Learning)
- 🔹[Data Preprocessing](./Data%20Preprocessing)
- 🔹[Python Cheat Sheet folder](./Python_Cheat_Sheet)

✨ The goal is to make theory **easy to understand** and connect it directly to **practice**.
