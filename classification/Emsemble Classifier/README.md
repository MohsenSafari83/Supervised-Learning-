#  Ensemble Classifier Project  

A comprehensive machine learning project exploring **Ensemble Learning** — combining multiple weak learners to create a powerful predictive model.  
This repository integrates both **theoretical concepts** and **practical implementation** using the **Bank Marketing Dataset**.  

---

## Overview

This project is divided into two main parts:  

1. **[ Documentation (Theory)](https://github.com/MohsenSafari83/Supervised-Learning-/tree/main/classification/Emsemble%20Classifier/docs)**  
   A theoretical exploration of ensemble methods, including:
   - Decision Tree fundamentals  
   - Random Forest and Bagging  
   - Boosting algorithms: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  
   - Conceptual differences between bagging and boosting  
   - Mathematical intuition and workflow illustrations  

2. **[Project (Practical Implementation)](https://github.com/MohsenSafari83/Supervised-Learning-/tree/main/classification/Emsemble%20Classifier/project)**  
   A hands-on application of ensemble classifiers using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** to predict whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit.  
   Includes:
   - Data preprocessing (encoding, outlier handling, feature scaling)  
   - Model training and tuning (Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)  
   - Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC)  
   - Model comparison and visual analysis
