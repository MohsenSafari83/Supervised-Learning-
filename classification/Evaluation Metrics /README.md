# Comprehensive Guide to Performance Metrics

This module is a complete theoretical and practical guide for understanding and implementing key evaluation metrics for **classification models**.  
The main goal is to go beyond **Accuracy** and understand the complexities of model evaluation in **imbalanced datasets**.
 
---

## Main Objectives of This Guide

1. Understand the limitations of **Accuracy** in imbalanced problems.  
2. Master the basic outcome definitions (**TP, TN, FP, FN**).  
3. Learn how to implement and interpret the **Confusion Matrix**.  
4. Understand the trade-off between **Precision** and **Recall**.  
5. Learn how to implement performance metrics using **Scikit-learn** in Python.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Basic Concepts

* **Accuracy:** definition, formula, and its limitations with real-world examples (e.g., cancer detection).  
* **Four Outcome Definitions:** detailed explanation of True Positive (TP), False Negative (FN), False Positive (FP), and True Negative (TN).  
* **Type I and Type II Errors:** understanding the difference between False Positive and False Negative.  

### 2. Core and Combined Metrics

* **Recall (Sensitivity):** importance in identifying actual positive cases.  
* **Precision:** importance in ensuring correctness of positive predictions.  
* **F1 Score:** understanding the harmonic mean and its role in balancing Precision and Recall.  

### 3. Advanced and Multi-class Evaluation

* **Confusion Matrix:** a visual and tabular tool for multi-class evaluation.  
* **Averaging Methods:** differences between **Micro-Averaging** and **Macro-Averaging**, and when to use each.  
* **AUC-ROC:** understanding the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** as a measure of a modelâ€™s discriminative ability.

This table summarizes the key performance metrics of the classification model, derived from the classification report, providing a quick overview of its performance across both classes.

| **Metric**    | **Malignant (63 Instances)** | **Benign (108 Instances)** | **Macro Avg** | **Weighted Avg** | **Support (Total)** |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Precision** | 0.97                          | 0.98                        | 0.97           | 0.98             | 171                  |
| **Recall**    | 0.97                          | 0.98                        | 0.97           | 0.98             | 171                  |
| **F1-Score**  | 0.97                          | 0.98                        | 0.97           | 0.98             | 171                  |
| **Accuracy**  |                               |                             |                | **0.98**         | 171                  |

## Key Observations

- **High Performance:** The model demonstrates strong performance across all metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) for both malignant and benign classes.  
- **Balance:** The scores for both classes are very close, showing that the model performs almost equally well on the minority class (**malignant: 63 instances**) and the majority class (**benign: 108 instances**).  
- **Accuracy:** The overall accuracy is **0.98 (98%)**.  
- **Weighted Average:** The weighted average (**0.98**) is slightly higher than the macro average (**0.97**) because it accounts for the larger number of instances in the *benign* class.
